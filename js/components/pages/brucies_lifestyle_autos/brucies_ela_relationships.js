                            Q. Why do most men never meet the woman of their dreams?<br/>
                        </span>
                        A. Stop dreaming and start living. Beautiful women only sleep with fat, bald or ugly men if they are 1) rich or 2) famous.

                        </span>
                        A. Because men are marrying women who do not live up to the porn ideal. Marry someone who cares about the things that matter to you - success, superficiality, good looks, and material possessions.

                        A. Because I can.

                        Imagine what would happen to your life if you were rich, famous and good-looking! More pussy than you can shake a stick-shift at, that's what. Women love having their reproductive organs waved at by a stick. Believe me, it worked for our ancestors and it works now. Welcome to my world. I'm a winner. Are you?

                    <p>
                        Don't settle for second best. Don't kid yourself that you can be happy with droopy tits and cottage cheese thighs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know I can't.
