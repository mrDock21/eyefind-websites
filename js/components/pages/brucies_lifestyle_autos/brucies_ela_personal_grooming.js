                        Image is everything. There are no second chances at first impressions. 
                        Hair frosting, eyebrow plucking, MANicures, pedicures, facials... in order to be a player, you have to look like a player. 
                        I don't have a single hair on my body and I tan twice a day.

                        I heard a girl say to her mother last week - "Look that man's made of mahogany!" I was so flattered that I gave her a pair of my signed workout briefs. 
                        It takes work and dedication to look this good. I have to combine three different moisturizers to get the right results. It's all about products. 
                        Products, products, products.

                        My aesthetician told me that she feels like Michelangelo working on the statue of David when she is waxing my back. 
                        I looked at a picture of that statue. He's got good definition but I'm so much more pumped. He also has a tiny cock. 
                        Unlike me. Mine is massive. That bitch will never work in the beauty industry again.
