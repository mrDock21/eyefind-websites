The question is, are you? Can you imagine waking up every morning and wanting to look at yourself for hours in the mirror? People try to label me as metrosexual and heteroflexible but I like to describe myself as a metromacho, a neo-narcissist: the ultimate blend of masculinity and desirability. The nineties were the age of the New Man. Now it's time for the Ultimate Man. A man with a blog, PDA, 20-inch rims, the 10-inch cock, the perfect body, big guns and the rock star lifestyle. You want it all, you deserve it all. I've got it all and more besides. And I can give it to you, for a price. Success is measured by looks, money, status and power. I tick all those boxes and I can show you how to get there. I can make you believe that you're better than you are. Like my cars, I'm well-tuned, fuel-injected, super-charged, streeted up, blinged-out and highly-polished. I'm VIP. Nobody brings as much to the table as me. I bring the table to the table. I set up a table and flip food into my hat, like at a hibachi. Don't be a bottom-feeder all your life. Experience what it's like to be at the very top of the food chain."
